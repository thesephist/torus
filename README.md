Minimal JS Model-View UI framework focused on being tiny, efficient, and free of dependencies.

You can find the [documentation for Torus here](https://thesephist.github.io/torus/api-documentation.html).

Torus also has an annotated, easy to read version of the entire (pretty concise) codebase, at its [Github Pages](https://thesephist.github.io/torus/). Check it out if you want to learn more about how the frameworks is designed, and how virtual DOM and templating works!

## Features

### Tiny without compromises

Torus has no production dependencies, requires no build step to take advantage of all of its features, and weighs in at under 5kB gzipped including the templating engine, renderer, component and event system, and CSS-in-JS wrapper. This makes it simple to adopt and ship, for anything from rendering a single component on the page to building full-scale applications.

### Fast and responsive by default

Torus isn't designed to be the fastest virtual DOM library (there are great alternatives like `inferno`), but performance and responsiveness are among the primary goals of the project. While remaining tiny, Torus tries to be as fast and responsive as possible, _especially_ in rendering. Combined with the tiny bundle size, this makes Torus great for building software for anywhere, on any device.

### Portable across the web platform

Torus's architecture encapsulates all of the rendering and updating logic within the component itself, so it's safe to take `Component#node` and treat it as a simple pointer to the root DOM element of the component. You can move it around the page, take it in and out of the document, embed it in React or Vue components, and otherwise use it anywhere a vanilla DOM element can be used. This allows you to include Torus components and apps in lots of other frontends.

Combined with the small size of Torus, this makes it reasonable to ship torus with only one or a few components for a larger project that includes elements from other frameworks, if you don't want to or can't ship an entire Torus application.

**Note**: Sometimes, like when the tag of the root element changes, `Component#node` can change as Torus needs to replace one element fully with a new element. For this reason, always use `#node` referenced from the component object, rather than caching the actual element `#node` points to at one point in time.

### Internationalization

Torus doesn't concern itself with internationalization, but as developers, we can use the APIs available to us make internationalization possible inside our Torus components. Torus exposes much of the rendering process and the virtual DOM to you, the developer, and importantly allows us create a `preprocessor` that can take in JDOM, and modify it before it reaches the renderer, so we can make modifications to the DOM that the renderer sees with our own code. This makes Torus highly extensible and ideal for i18n. In fact, the component preprocessor API is what makes Torus's `Styled()` components possible. (`Styled()` adds a new class name to the JDOM before the component is rendered.)

For example, we might make an `I18nComponent`, which can act as a base component class for an internationalized project, like this.

```javascript
class I18nComponent extends Component {

    // The default preprocess method just returns the jdom as-is. We can override it
    //  to modify the JDOM given by component's `#compose()` method before it reaches the
    //  virtual DOM renderer.
    preprocess(jdom, _data) {
        // Here, we might recursively traverse the JDOM tree of children
        //  and call some custom `translate()` function on each string child
        //  and any displayed props like `placeholder` and `title`.
        //  As a trivial example, if we only cared about text nodes on the page,
        //  we could write...
        const translate = jdom => {
            if (typeof jdom === 'string') {
                // translate text nodes
                return yourImplementationOfTranslateString(jdom);
            } else if (Array.isArray(jdom.children)) {
                // it's an object-form JDOM, so recursively translate children
                jdom.children = jdom.children.map(yourImplementationOfTranslateString);
                return jdom;
            }
            return jdom;
        }

        // In production, we'd also want to translate some user-visible properties,
        //  so we may also detect and translate attrs like `title` and `placeholder`.
        return translate(jdom);
    }

}
```

## Influences

Torus's API is a mixture of declarative interfaces for defining user interfaces and views, and imperative patterns for state management, which I personally find is the best balance of the two styles when building large applications. As a general practice, components should try to remain declarative and idempotent, and interact with data models / state via public, stable imperative APIs exposed by data models.

Torus's design is inspired by React's component-driven architecture, and borrows common concepts from the React ecosystem, like the idea of diffing in virtual DOM before rendering, composition with higher order components, and mixing CSS and markup into JavaScript to separate concerns for each component into a single class. But Torus builds on those ideas by providing a more minimal, less opinionated lower-level APIs, and opting for a stateful data model rather than a view/controller layer that strives to be purely functional.

Torus also borrows from [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) in its data models design, for Records and Stores, for having an event-driven design behind how data updates are bound to views and other models.

Lastly, Torus's `jdom` template tag was inspired by [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm) and [lit-html](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html), both template tags to process HTML markup into virtual DOM.

## Installation and usage

You can install Torus from NPM as `torus-dom`. Torus is still considered _beta_, and not to a 1.0 release yet. I believe the API is stable now and most of the major bugs have been squashed, but no guarantees until 1.0.

```sh
npm install --save torus-dom
# or
yarn add torus-dom
```

```javascript
import { Component, Record, Store } from 'torus-dom';
```

Alternatively, you can also just import Torus with:

```html
<script src="/path/to/your/torus.js"></script>
```

Torus will export all of its default globals to `window.Torus`, so they're accessible as global names to your scripts. This isn't recommended in production apps, but great for experimenting.

## Contributing

If you find bugs, please open an issue or put in a pull request with a test to recreate the bug against what you expected Torus to do. If you have feature requests, I might not necessarily honor it, because Torus is being built mostly to suit my personal workflow and architecture preferences. But I'm open to hearing your opinion! So feel free to open an issue, with the expectation that I might not decide to add the feature to Torus (especially if it'll inflate the bundle size or require a transpiler.)

### Builds

To build Torus, run

```sh
npm build
# or
yarn build
```

This will run `./src/torus.js` through a custom toolchain, first removing any debug function calls and running that result through Webpack, through both `development` and `production` modes. Both outputs, as well as the vanilla version of Torus without Webpack processing, are saved to `./dist/`.

### Generating documentation from comments

Torus has a unique system for generating documentation from code comments that begin with `//>`. To generate comment docs, run

```sh
npm run docs
# or
yarn docs
```

Docs files will be generated at `./docs/` and are viewable on a web browser. Check out [the Github page for this project](https://thesephist.github.io/torus/) for an example of what this script generates.

### Running tests

To run Torus's unit tests and generate a coverage report to `coverage/`, run

```sh
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

This will run the basic test suite on a development build of Torus. More comprehensive integration tests using full user interfaces like todo apps is on the roadmap.

We can also run tests on the production build, with:

```sh
npm test:prod
# or
yarn test:prod
```

This **won't generate a coverage report**, but will run the tests against a minified, production build at `dist/torus.min.js` to verify no compilation bugs occurred.
